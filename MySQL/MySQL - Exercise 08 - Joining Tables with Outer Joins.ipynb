    "# MySQL Exercise 8: Joining Tables with Outer Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on inner joins in the last set of exercises.  Most of the time inner joins will give you the results you are looking for.  Occasionally, though, you might want to include all the data from a table in your calculations or your output, even if those data do not all match up with the data from the other tables you are joining with.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, if you have a table with customer demographic information and a table with information about which customers were sent a free sample, your might want to analyze the characteristics of customers who did and did not receive the sample.  The best way to do that in a program like Tableau would be to have all your customer information in one table with an extra column indicating whether the customer received the free sample or not.  Alternatively, you might want to generate a list of customers who did *not* receive the free sample, so that you can arrange for the customers to receive a free sample in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these types of situations, you will use outer joins to connect tables.  Outer joins include left joins, right joins, or full outer joins (recall that full outer joins are NOT supported in MySQL).  Refer to the videos \"What are Joins?\" and \"Joins With Many to Many Relationships and Duplicates\" for more information about joins. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a picture to remind you of the general concepts behind outer joins:\n",

    "## Left and Right Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Left and right joins use a different sytax than we used in the lesson about inner joins.  The method I showed you to execute inner joins tells the database how to relate tables in a WHERE clause like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "WHERE d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I find this syntax -- called the \"equijoin\" syntax -- to be very intuitive, so I thought it would be a good idea to start with it.  However, we can re-write the inner joins in the same syntax used by outer joins.  To use this more traditional syntax, you have to tell the database how to connect the tables using an ON clause that comes right after the FROM clause.  Make sure to specify the word \"JOIN\" explicitly.  This traditional version of the syntax frees up the WHERE clause for other things you might want to include in your query.  Here's what one of our queries from the inner join lesson would look like using the traditional syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.user_guid AS UserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type\n",
    "FROM dogs d JOIN reviews r\n",
    "  ON d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid\n",
    "GROUP BY d.user_guid\n",
    "HAVING NumRatings > 9\n",
    "ORDER BY AvgRating DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also write \"INNER JOIN\" instead of \"JOIN\" but the default in MySQL is that JOIN will mean inner join, so including the word \"INNER\" is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a WHERE clause in the query above, it would go after the ON clause and before the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a different query we used in the last lesson that employed the equijoin syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT d.user_guid AS UserID, d.dog_guid AS DogID, \n",
    "       d.breed, d.breed_type, d.breed_group\n",
    "FROM dogs d, complete_tests c\n",
    "WHERE d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid AND test_name='Yawn Warm-up';\n",
    "```\n",

    "Now that we've seen the join syntax, we can begin practicing outer joins. Our Dognition data set will make outer joins more challenging than usual, due to the lack of declared primary keys in the original database, the many-to-many relationships, and the presence of duplicate rows and NULL values in columns we will be using to combine tables.  Mastering outer joins in this challenging context, though, will ensure that you understand the fundamental concepts behind joins, which will be a terrific benefit when you start writing queries in other company databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first query I described above was originally written to address the question of whether dog owners who are particularly surprised by their dog's performance on Dognition tests tend to own similar breeds of dogs. When we designed this query in the last lesson, we wanted to focus on the dog owners who reported the highest average amount of surprise at their dog's performance, and provided at least 10 ratings for one or more of their dogs in the ratings.  We also wanted to examine the breed, breed_type, and breed_group of each of these owner's dogs.  \n",

    "\n",
    "+ All of the user_guids in the reviews table are in the dogs table\n",

    "The inner join we executed resulted in 389 rows of output, because it only included the data from rows that have equivalent values in both tables being joined.  But what if we wanted the full list of dogs in the reviews table and an indication of whether or not they were in the dogs table, rather than only a list of review information from dogs in the dogs table?  To achieve this list, we could execute an outer join.  \n",
    "     \n",
    "Let's start by using a left outer join to get the list we want. When we use the traditional join syntax to write inner joins, the order you enter the tables in your query doesn't matter. In outer joins, however, the order matters a lot. A left outer join will include all of the rows of the table to the left of the LEFT JOIN clause. A right outer join will include all of the rows of the table to the right of the RIGHT JOIN clause. So in order to retrieve a full list of dogs who completed at least 10 tests in the reviews table, and include as much breed information as possible, we could query:\n",

When you examine the dogs table, you see that there are a lot of entries that have \"Shih Tzu\" in the breed column and \"190\" in the weight column.  This was Dognition's internal convention for indicating test accounts.  So these dog_guids and user_guids do not represent real data.

Our join statement imposed the criteria that the output should only include pairs whose user_guids matched in the two linking columns.  However, since there were multiple rows that had the same user_guid in the users table, *each one of these rows got paired up with each row in the dogs table that had the same user_guid.*  The result was 442 rows, because 17 (instances of the user_guid in the users table) x 26 (instances of the user_guid in the dogs table) = 442.\n",

    "Having seen this, perhaps you can now appreciate why some database experts emphasize terminology that differentiates between set *theory* and real database *implementation*.  Database operations, like those that join tables, are based on set theory that assumes there are no duplicate rows in your tables.  In real life, duplicate rows get entered all the time, and it can cause you to misinterpret your queries if you do not understand the consequences.  If you've been impacted enough times by the differences between real and theoretical databases, it makes sense that it would be important to you to use language that clearly distinguishes between theory and real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important things I want you to remember from this example of joins with duplicates are that duplicate rows and table relationships that have table-to-table mappings of greater than 1 have multiplicative effects on your query results, due to the way relational databases combine tables.  If you write queries that aggregate over a lot of joined tables, it can be very difficult to catch issues that output results you don't intend, because the aggregated results will hide clues from you.   To prevent this from happening, I recommend you adopt the following practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Avoid making assumptions about your data or your analyses.  For example, rather than assume that all the values in a column are unique just because some documentation says they should be, check for yourself!\n",
    "+ Always look at example outputs of your queries before you strongly interpret aggregate calculations. Take extra care to do this when your queries require joins.  \n",
    "+ When your queries require multiple layers of functions or joins, examine the output of each layer or join first before you combine them all together. \n",
    "+ Adopt a healthy skepticsm of all your data and results.  If you see something you don't expect, make sure you explore it before interpreting it strongly or incorporating it into other analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more type of join to mention that I discussed in the joins videos is a full outer join. Full outer joins include all of the rows in both tables in an ON clause, regardless of whether there is a value that links the row of one table with a row in the other table.  As with left or right joins, whenever a value in a row does not have a matching value in the joined table, NULLs will be entered for all values in the joined table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer joins are used very rarely.  The most practical application is if you want to export all of your raw data to another program for visualization or analysis. The syntax for outer joins is the same as for inner joins, but you replace the word \"inner\" with \" full outer\":\n",
